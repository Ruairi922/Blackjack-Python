In the program the user will be dealt 2 cards randomly as will the dealer.(dealers cards not shown until player chose to stand)
User can choose to get another random card.
If player total exceeds 21 the user loses the game
If dealers hand is more than users total but less than 22 the dealer wins.




Update: Had trouble getting the dealer to pull more than 3 cards without creating an infinite loop.
        Dealer can only pull a max of 3 cards.
        Any tips is appreciated.
